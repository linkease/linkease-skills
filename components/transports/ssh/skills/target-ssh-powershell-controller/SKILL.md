# SSH PowerShell target controller

Use this only for a target that exposes PowerShell through OpenSSH. System-specific diagnosis and changes remain in the selected System Pack.

Set `TARGET_ID`, `TARGET_SSH_HOST`, `TARGET_SSH_USER`, and `TARGET_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`; optionally set port, identity, and timeout. Credentials stay in an SSH agent or protected key file. Unknown or changed host keys are a hard stop.

```sh
sh scripts/target-ssh-powershell.sh inspect < inspect.ps1
sh scripts/target-ssh-powershell.sh plan < plan.ps1
TARGET_CHANGE_APPROVED=YES sh scripts/target-ssh-powershell.sh apply < apply.ps1
sh scripts/target-ssh-powershell.sh verify < verify.ps1
```

The script is sent over stdin and executes only on the bound target. `apply` requires fresh user approval. Timeout, cancellation, authentication, and shell startup failures are transport errors, not operating-system conclusions.
